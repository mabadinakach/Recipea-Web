### Roles:
Jennalyn Kabiling (SCRUM Master), Marcos Abadi (Front-End/Back-End), JConr B. Riddell (Front-End), Lily Moon (Front-End/Back-End)

### Project Foundings:
This project was developed as a passion project, founded on the idea of needing to improve the simple idea of finding a good recipe to make. Especially in a time like this, we are needing to find more accessible ways to make meals and feed our families with what we have in our fridge. So our website will allow users to choose from either a selected recipe based on their chosen ingredients or have a random one developed. This website gives the user a new spiced up ability to not only create recipes, but also the opportunity to be introduced into new recipes.
